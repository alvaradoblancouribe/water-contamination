		<p> Between 1982 and 2015, between 9 million and 45 million Americans got their drinking water from a source that was in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act, specially people living in rural, low income areas. Many low income rural counties have small water systems and can’t afford the latest and best treatment operator, and sometimes can’t afford to have a full time operator, leading them to purchase treated water from larger utilities. Below you can see how race and socioeconomic status play a role into the access of high quality of water. </p>
