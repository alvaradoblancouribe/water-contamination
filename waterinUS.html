			<p> Drinking water is regulated in many different ways in the United States. In order to take care of our bodies, it is important to learn more about the organizations that treat and regulate the water we consume. </p>
			<h2> Food and Drug Administration Regulations </h2>
			<p> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates water bottles as food. They require the identification of the source and regulate the allowable levels of chemical, physical, microbial, and radiological contaminants. </p> 
			<p>The FDA does not have a mandatory testing program for drinking water, unlike the EPA. A recall of the water bottles can happen if serious problems with the quality appear. However, this does not guarantee that the bottled water is safe.
			</p>
			<h2> Environmental Protection Agency </h2>
			<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is in charge of regulating tap water across the United States. They preform national testings for contaminants in public water systems. Even though these tests are funded by tax-payer money, many reports are never made public. </p>
			<p> Many of the EPAâ€™s regulations can be changed or relaxed depending on who is holding office in the White House. 
			</p>
			<h2> Where Does Tap Water Come From? </h2>
			<p> Tap water is sourced from surface water or ground water </p>
			<p>Groundwater comes from the rain and snow that the ground absorbs. This water gets stored in open spaces in the ground. Wells can be created to collect it. However, this is not common since only around 15% of Americans have private wells in their homes. </p>
			<p>Surface water comes from rain and snow that merges into rivers, lakes, and streams. This is the most popular source of tap water in the United States, as two in three Americans will get their tap water from rivers and streams. Fun fact: if you live in New York, your water comes from the Delaware River basin and if you are from Seattle, your water comes from the Cedar and Tolt rivers.
