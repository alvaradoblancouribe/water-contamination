			<p> Educate the audience on FDA regulations on water, natural bodies of water in the US used for water consumption, and how water quality in the US compares to other countries </p>
			<h2> Food and Drug Administration Regulations </h2>
			<p> The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates water bottles as food. They require the identification of the source and regulate the allowable levels of chemical, physical, microbial, and radiological contaminates. </p> 
			<p>The FDA does not have a mandatory testing program for drinking water. A recall can happen if serious problems with the water appear. However, this does not guarantee that the bottled water is safe
			</p>
			<h2> Environmental Protection Agency </h2>
			<p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is in charge of regulating the tap water across the United States. They preform national tastings for contaminants in public water systems. Even though these tests are funded by tax-payer money, many reports are never made public. </p>
			<p> Many of the EPAâ€™s regulations can be changed or relaxed depending on who is holding office in the White House. 
			</p>
			<h2> Where Does Tap Water Come From? </h2>
			<p> Drinking water comes from surface water or ground water </p>
			<p>Groundwater comes from the rain and snow that the ground absorbs. This water gets stored in open spaces in the ground, where wells are created to collect it. Around 15% of Americans have private wells in their homes. </p>
			<p>Surface water also comes from rain and snow, but merges into rivers, lakes, and streams. This is the most popular source of tap water in the United States, as two in three Americans will get their tap water from rivers and streams. For example, if you live in New York, your water comes from the Delaware River basin and if you are from Seattle, your water comes from the Cedar and Tolt rivers.
